    <p>
           I’m a 23-year-old Egyptian Software Developer with a background in Electrical Engineering, having graduated from HTI in 2024. Based in Fayoum, Egypt, my journey into tech has been fueled by curiosity and a drive to create—from low-level embedded systems to sleek, user-focused interfaces.<br/>

I’ve studied Embedded Systems and Front-End Development, and I’m currently advancing my skills through Full-Stack Development. I’m proficient in multiple programming languages, including C, Python, Dart, Flutter, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with hands-on experience in tools like FlutterFlow and Figma for UI/UX design.<br/>

I also have experience in 3D Modeling and Photography, which bring a creative and visual edge to my design thinking. I enjoy blending technical problem-solving with aesthetic thinking, and I’m always looking to learn, collaborate, and build projects that matter.
